        I use a text editor that can write code and edit it, it is called <a href="https://atom.io/" target="_blank">Atom</a> but there are also other text editors like <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/" target="_blank">Notepad++</a> or <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/"  target="_blank">Sublime</a>. Before that, throughout a few weeks I learned <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Lanuage">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> (Programming Languages) and then I started working a few tiny projects like websites and I plan to only get better.

      <div class="desc">
        Once I learned how to code I was very interested in how to improve so I learned CSS a coding language were it's more about styling text instead of making it. In the future, I plan to learn Javascript which will help me make more creative things on my websites.
