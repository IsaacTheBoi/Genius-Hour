        I use a text editor that can write code and edit it it is called <a href="https://atom.io/" target="_blank">Atom</a> but there is also other text editors like <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/" target="_blank">Notepad++</a> or <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/"  target="_blank">Sublime</a>. Before that through out a few weeks I learned <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Lanuage">Html</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">Css</abbr> (Programing Languages) and then I started working a few tiny projects like websites and I plan to only get better.

      <div class="desc">
        Once I learned how to code I was very intrested in how to improve so I learned css a coding lanuage were its more about styling text insted of making it. In the future I plan to learn Javascript which will help me make more creative things on my websites.
